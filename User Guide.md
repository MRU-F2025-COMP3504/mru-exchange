## Abstract
MRU Exchange is a campus-exclusive marketplace where students can buy, sell, and trade resources directly tied to MRU life---Parking, Textbooks, Notes, and Tutoring to start. This idea is similar to systems like Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji, but unlike these public platforms, MRU Exchange is student-only (verified @mtroyal email) and emphasizes saftey/trust/convenience. The aim is a single, reliable hub for student needs---simpler, safer, cheaper.
