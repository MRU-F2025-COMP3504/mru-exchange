# Abstract

> MRU Exchange is a campus-exclusive marketplace where students can buy, sell, and trade resources
> directly tied to MRU life---Parking, Textbooks, Notes, and Tutoring to start.
> This idea is similar to systems like Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji, but unlike these public platforms,
> MRU Exchange is student-only (verified `@mtroyal` email) and emphasizes saftey/trust/convenience.
> The aim is a single, reliable hub for student needs---simpler, safer, cheaper.
